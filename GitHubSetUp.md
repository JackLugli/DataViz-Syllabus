#GitHub Set Up
I have attempted to make this guide as simple and clear as possible for those without any GitHub experience. It is written for Macs but can be adapted to PCs. If you have questions, please do let me know so I can continue to improve the document.

<a id="Getting-Set-Up-at-GitHub.com"></a>
##Getting Set Up at GitHub.com <a id="Getting-Set-Up-at-GitHub.com"></a>

<p>Students of course first need to set up an account. After a discussion of visual communication principles and the strengths of GitHub, we set it up on the first day. It is easy at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub.com.</a> 
<p>Students first register and follow along with, but adapt, the <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">Git Hub setup guide, "Hello World."</a></p>

My **annotations** for Hello World:
- for **Signup**, students should use their first and last name: for example, jacklule -- NOT LEHIGH USER NAME
- before "Create a Repository", students should follow the tip to open up the Hello World guide in a **separate tab** and work in another tab
- also before creating a repository, GitHub will ask, **Please verify email address**; students will need to open their email in yet another tab or perhaps their phone
- for the repository, no need to name it, "Hello World;" can **name Data Viz**
- click Public
- **Important - Easy to miss this step: Click Initialize with ReadMe; notice ReadMe is md file**
- **Not necessary** Students also can do Issue and Create Branch, notice **working in branch, not master**; students will not use that often in early stages; they will work in master, but it is good practice and shows the great possibility of collaboration
- click to access ReadMe (**notice we are in branch**);
- click pencil icon in top right to **edit ReadMe**; practice md and preview as go along
- -write a Commit title or message (**grey default can be written over**)
- can check ReadMe in branch and master to see difference; **master is still unedited; changes have not been pulled in**
- **request a pull**; (you will not usually make a request of yourself and just work on master) New Pull Request
- as creator of the master branch, you **compare change**; either in grey base box, master>branch; or click on edit link; notice changes in green and red
- click **confirm merge** and **delete branch** to keep things clean
- check your repository; changes made and the branch has been deleted; again, students will not use branches much but they can see the advantage of collaborative work flow; check the **GitHub work flow** link
<p>For homework, students should edit their ReadMe page with more information about themselves and their education. They should also add a photo and more information to their profile, all the while gaining experience with markdown.</p>

<a id="To-Change-a-User-Name-after-Set-Up"></a>
##To Change a User Name after Set Up

- Students sometimes sign up at github.com with their clunky Lehigh user name (ie. jl0d219) rather than their real name. It is best to change that early before the creation of other connecting pages.
- Go to github.com/currentusername. In top right corner, click on the arrow for a drop down menu and go to Settings.
- In the left column, click Account. Click Change username. The github.com/username should now be changed.
- If the student also created a uername.github.io repository with the clunky user name, it might be easiest just to delete that repository and create a new one. (It is also possible to edit that repository.) To delete: At github.com/username, click on repository username.github.io. In top right, click Settings. Scroll down to the red Danger Zone and click delete this repository. Follow the steps below, Getting Set Up at GitHub.io without GitHub Desktop 2017, to create a new repository.

<a id="Getting-Set-Up-at-GitHub.io-without-GitHub-Desktop-2017"></a>
##Getting Set Up at GitHub.io without GitHub Desktop 2017

<p>In 2017, GitHub changed how users could generate their own web pages. I will leave the instructions below in case GitHub returns to its former method. But for 2017:</p>

- Go to github.com/username > In top right, under +, get drop down menu and select New Repository.
- Type in repository name: username.github.io
- Click Initialize with a ReadMe page. (If students do not initialize, they will be taken to a Quick Setup Page that will require some coding. They can avoid that by finding the link for ReadMe under Quick SetUp).
- Once repository is created, students will see only the ReadMe page.
- In top right, click on Settings and scroll down to Choose a Theme. Students can view and then Select Theme.
- Students will be taken to the Editing window of their ReadMe page, which now has Welcome to GitHub Pages and instructions for using md language and information about Jekyll themes.
- Students should scroll down to Commit the Changes.
- The web page should be created at username.github.io.
- Students can easily start to edit the content on the ReadMe page (**which has replaced the former index.html page in earlier versions**).

<a id="Getting-Set-Up-at-GitHub.io-without-GitHub-Desktop"></a>
##Getting Set Up at GitHub.io without GitHub Desktop

- Students should go to their github.com page and click the Repositories tab.</p>
- On the far right, find the button that says New.
- Give the repository name the exact username.github.io
- **Important: Click Initialize this repository with a README**
- Commit
- Open that repository and click Create New File.
- Name file: index.html
- In the text box, put GitHub's suggested opening text in html **(enclosing lines between < and >)**
- !DOCTYPE html
- html
- body
- h1>Hello World</h1
- p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p
- /body
- /html
- Commit.

<a id="Getting-Set-Up-at-GitHub.io-with-GitHub-Desktop"></a>
##Getting Set Up at GitHub.io with GitHub Desktop

<p> To work in GitHub Desktop, students should follow the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages guide</a>, using "User or organization" site and "GitHub for Mac" to set up their .io repository page, which will serve as a Portfolio of their work for the class and for future employers.</p>

My **annotations** for GitHub Pages Guide:
- It is best if GitHub for Mac could already be installed on the local computer. But GitHub asks for admin approval and so profs may want to do that step before classes begin.
- Students however will first need to [Authenticate and Sign In](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started/authenticating-to-github/) on the local computer since Set Up was skipped with the professor installing the app. The basic steps: Open GitHub Desktop > go to top left GitHub Desktop menu > Preferences> Accounts > Sign In to GitHub. Also, in the Advanced tab, students should log in to Git Config. **Then exit GitHub Desktop.**
- Go to the [GitHub Pages Guide](https://pages.github.com/) and follow steps.
- But **go out of order** and go to Step 1.5, the question mark and indicate client using GitHub for Mac.
- Then go to Step 1: "Head over to GitHub" means go to **github.com/username** and create a new repository named **username.github.io**
- Step 2: Clone the Repository. This **may** be accomplished by merely clicking Set Up in Desktop. Students will need to know, however, where the local repo is being stored on the computer. They can search Finder for where the folder has been stored.
- If the cloning does not work, here are [GitHub instructions for cloning](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/); desktop instructions are near the bottom: Go to repo's main page; click on clipboard to copy the URL for the rep; go to GitHub Desktop, verify name and location of where the file should be; click Clone.
- GitHub then says, **grab your favorite text editor**: not so simple; next step:

<a id="To-Set-Up-TextEdit-to-Create-html-Pages"></a>
##To Set Up TextEdit to Create html Pages
- Students must **set up their text editor to create html pages**. For the Mac, this means to edit Preferences in Apple TextEdit. [Apple Support: How to Set Up TextEdit](https://support.apple.com/kb/ta20406?locale=en_US). In sum: Under Preferences > New Document > click the Plain Text radio button under Format; Under Open and Save, When Saving a File, click the checkbox to turn off "Append '.txt' extension to plain text files." Students will now be able to save text edits as html pages. (And for future editing, in Open and Save, students can also click on Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text.")
- Also see [Creating an html page](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)
- Students can then take the next step in the Pages Guide and create an index.html page
- Opening up the Mac's TextEdit, students will follow the html directions at the Guide to create the html page
- Students then save that page, using rich text format (not save as web page) and adding the html extension: index.html. This page should be saved to their GitHub repository on the local computer
- GitHub will recognize a change has been made to the repository. Students then commit the changes and sync with their GitHub site
- The sync will add the html page to name.github.com
- Students can view the html page through any browser

Students thus have learned to code and create a new html page to embed and publish each assignment thus doubling the value of each lesson. **To check on troubles, view Page Source. Right click with PCs; Option+Command+u for Macs.**

<a id="To-edit-an-html-page-in-TextEdit"></a>
##To Edit an html Page in TextEdit
TextEdit will open a previously created html page as an html file, not in text edit. To edit an html page in TextEdit:
- Under TextEdit, find Preferences
- Go to the “Open and Save” tab, check the box, “Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text” 
- Under "New Document," make TextEdit default to "plain text" (instead of "rich text")

<a id="To-Customize-the-Github.io-Page"></a>
##To Customize the GitHub.io Page
Remembering that the page eventually will be their GitHub portfolio, students should follow these steps:
- Students should have already **set up their repo site at github.io**, using the directions above and at [Git Hub Pages guide above](https://pages.github.com/)
- After creating username.github.io, students can personalize that page;
- They should go to page --- username.github.io -- and find the **setting** link to the top right;
- Scroll down to Update site and click on Automatic Page Generator;
- Keep the repository page name: name.github.io
- provide a brief tagline of description;
- scroll past generic text and continue to Layout; 
- I chose Minimal but students can pick from other styles;
- the repo/portfolio page is now customized;
- Students can then go to their index page at github.com, click edit, remove the old Hello World text from the index and begin providing their own content;
- Here is the result for me at [my GitHub Page](http://jacklule.github.io/)

<a id="To-Publish-Other-Work-at-GitHub.io"></a>
##To Publish Other Work at GitHub.io
To publish other work, such as charts, Tableau files and YouTube videos to GitHub.io:

- **To publish work saved on the local computer**, such as svg files produced by Chartbuilder: 1) Students would complete the assignment at Chartbuilder; 2) download the svg file to their local computer (the other option, png files, do not render consistently); 3) create an html page for the assignment; 4) insert the svg file into the html page; 5) upload the html page to their github.io site. Here are examples of a Chartbuilder assignment in svg and png format: [Chartbuilder svg test](http://jacklule.github.io/pages/SVGtest.html) and [Chartbuilder png test](http://jacklule.github.io/pages/PNGtest.html)
- **To embed and publish work hosted on sites**, such as Tableau or YouTube: 1) Students would complete the assignment on Tableau; 2) get the embed code at Tableau; 3) create an html page for the assignment; 4) embed the Tableau work into the html page; 5) upload the html page to their github.io site. Here are examples: [You Tube Embed Test](http://jacklule.github.io/pages/YouTubeEmbedTest.html) and [Tableau Embed Test](http://jacklule.github.io/pages/embed-test-Tableau.html)
- **To "hand in" the assignment**, students would: 1) Copy the file path --"copy path" -- for the assignment page and paste that link into their "Portfolio" page, name.github.io; 2) The students may need to add http:// in front of the assigment file path name on their Portfolio page for the pasted url to work; 3) Students would then notfiy me that the assignment was completed and send me the url for the Portfolio page.
- Again, name.github.io will be **The Portfolio** page, a collection of Data Viz work that can be shared with future employers.

<a id="To-Create-and-Manage-Files-and-Folders"></a>
##To Create and Manage Files and Folders
**Creating folders within GitHub**:
- go to the folder inside which you want to create another folder
- click on New file
- on the text field for creatng the file name, after the /, type the *folder* name you want to create and hit Enter
- on the next text field to the right, after the /, type the *file* name (type .md if you want that style) and hit Enter
- this creates a folder.
- [Here is GitHub help on Moving Files](https://help.github.com/articles/moving-a-file-to-a-new-location/)

<a id="To-Delete-a-Repository"></a>
##To Delete a Repository
- Students can make mistakes in the early stages of constructing a repository. Sometimes it is easier just to delete and start over.
- From the github.com/name page, click on the Repositories Tab
- click on the repository to be deleted
- find and click Settings icon
- scroll down to the Danger section and delete

<a id="Working-with-GitHub-in-a-computer-lab"></a>
##Working with GitHub in a Computer Lab
Students likely will not have administrative access to download and install GitHub for Mac in a computer lab. Perhaps the students can start the dowload and the instructor could type in the JournalismAdmin password. Or the instructor could do all the downloads before classes begin. 

For students then to set up GitHub.io pages, follow the four-step process at [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or see above, [Getting Set Up at GitHub.io](#Getting-Set-Up-at-GitHub.io), but also follow these annotations:

1. Create a repository at github.com: 
  - name.github.io
  - select GitHub for Mac as client
2. Clone the repository: 
  - GitHub.com might give “Setup in Desktop” as an option. That should clone the repository on the local computer.
  - If that option does not appear: Instructions say to “launch the local app.” That means, find GitHub on the local Mac and open. At top bar, go to File>Clone Repository. Defaults say: “clone as name.github.io” and where (GitHub folder): press okay
  - The repository should now be cloned (copied) onto local computer.
  - But **where is GitHub stored locally?**
  - Outside of a lab, GitHub on a Mac is stored under Home, with Documents, Downloads etc. In a computer lab, GitHub will be stored under Users, for example: Mac3>Users>DataViz>GitHub>name.github.io
  - To access: Finder>top bar> Go> Home(opens as DataViz)> GitHub folder. Inside that folder should be another folder name.github.io
3. Create an Index file
  - The local Mac’s text edit needs to have been adjusted so it can create and save an html page. See instructions above. 
  - Save the html file. It should automatically save without prompting to local folder: name.github.io. Can check using instructions above, "Where is GitHub stored locally?"
4. Commit and Sync
  - Go back to GitHub desktop. You should see “1 uncommitted page.”
  - Click and see the new html page.
  - Provide a summary and description and then “commit to master.”
  - Page is now on the local GitHub master.
  - Click sync. The local and GitHub.com repositories are now synced.
  - To check online: Go to the io repository at name.github.com. The index.html file should be now in the github.com repository.
